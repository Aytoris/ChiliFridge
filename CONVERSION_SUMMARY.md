2. **No automatic sync**: Each device has its own data
3. **localStorage limits**: ~5-10MB typical (more than enough)
4. **HTTPS required**: For PWA installation (hosting provides this)
5. **Chrome recommended**: Best PWA support on Android

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. No cross-device sync (by design - fully local)
2. No cloud backup (can be added later)
3. Data tied to browser storage
